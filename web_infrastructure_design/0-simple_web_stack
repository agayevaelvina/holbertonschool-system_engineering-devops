A user wants to access the website www.foobar.com.

The domain name www.foobar.com is configured with a DNS A record that points to the IP address 8.8.8.8.

At IP address 8.8.8.8, there is one server running:

- A web server (Nginx), which listens for HTTP requests.
- An application server (e.g., PHP-FPM), which runs the backend logic.
- The application codebase, containing all website files.
- A MySQL database, which stores persistent data.

Nginx communicates with the user's browser via HTTP/HTTPS.
Nginx forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
The application may query the MySQL database for data.

Limitations:
- Single Point of Failure: if the server fails, the whole website goes down.
- Maintenance causes downtime.
- No scalability for handling large traffic volumes.

DNS Details:
- Domain: foobar.com
- Subdomain: www
