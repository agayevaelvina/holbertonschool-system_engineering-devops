This infrastructure design scales up a basic web system for better performance, availability, and separation of concerns.

Components added:

1. One additional server:
   - Purpose: To allow horizontal scaling and better resource distribution.
   - Benefit: More traffic can be handled and there's less chance of overloading a single server.

2. Load Balancer Cluster (2 HAProxy instances):
   - Purpose: Create a highly available load balancing setup.
   - Configuration: HAProxy instances are configured in a cluster (active-active or active-passive).
   - Benefit: Prevents a single point of failure at the load balancing layer.

3. Split components into dedicated servers:
   a. Web Server (e.g., Nginx):
      - Handles HTTP requests and static files.
   b. Application Server (e.g., Gunicorn):
      - Runs the dynamic application logic.
   c. Database Server (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL):
      - Stores and manages data.

   - Purpose: Each component is deployed on a separate server.
   - Benefit: Improves performance, allows independent scaling, and enforces separation of concerns.
