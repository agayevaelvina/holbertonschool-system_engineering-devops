This infrastructure hosts www.foobar.com and uses:

- A DNS A record (www.foobar.com â†’ 8.8.8.8)
- 1 Load Balancer (HAProxy) configured with Round-Robin distribution algorithm
- 2 Backend servers, each running:
  - Nginx (Web Server)
  - Application Server (e.g., PHP)
  - Application files (codebase)
  - MySQL (one Primary, one Replica)

The Load Balancer uses an Active-Active setup, meaning both backend servers actively receive traffic.

MySQL is configured in a Primary-Replica cluster:
- Primary: handles write and read
- Replica: handles read-only
- The application writes to the Primary and reads from the Replica to reduce load

Issues:
- SPOFs:
  - Load Balancer (if it fails, all traffic is blocked)
  - MySQL Primary (no writes if it fails)
- Security:
  - No firewall
  - No HTTPS (data not encrypted in transit)
- No monitoring or alerting for failures

This setup improves scalability and availability over a single-server model but still lacks full redundancy.
