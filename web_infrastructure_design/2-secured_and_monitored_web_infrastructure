This infrastructure hosts www.foobar.com with encryption, security, and monitoring:

Components:
- DNS A record: www.foobar.com → 8.8.8.8 (Load Balancer IP)
- Load Balancer (HAProxy) with SSL certificate to serve HTTPS
- 3 Firewalls:
  - Firewall 1: protects Load Balancer (allows HTTPS only)
  - Firewall 2 & 3: protect backend servers (allow limited ports)
- 2 Backend servers, each with:
  - Nginx Web Server
  - Application Server
  - MySQL (Primary on Server 1, Replica on Server 2)
  - Monitoring Client (e.g., Sumo Logic agent)

SSL ensures secure, encrypted traffic. Firewalls block unauthorized access. Monitoring agents collect logs and metrics.

Monitoring:
- Collects system metrics (CPU, disk, memory)
- Parses web server logs to track QPS (Queries Per Second)
- Sends data to external service (Sumo Logic or similar)

Issues:
- SSL termination at the Load Balancer leaves internal traffic unencrypted.
- Only one MySQL Primary – if it fails, no writes possible.
- Servers have full stack (Web, App, DB) – harder to scale or isolate failures.

This design is secure and observable, but not fully redundant or scalable.
